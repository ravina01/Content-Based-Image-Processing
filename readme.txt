    1. executables added to run baseline.cpp and calculation.cpp in CMakeLists.txt file to run task1
    2. But, to execute other task please add following in your cmakeLists.txt file
    3. Task 2 : histogram2D.cpp and histogram3D.cpp
    4. task 3 : multiHistogram3D.cpp
    5. Task 4 : textureColor.cpp
    6. Task 5 : customDesign.cpp
    7. Extension 1 : gaborExtension.cpp to run gabor filter texture analysis.
    8. Extension 2 : run customDesign.cpp to collect all blue trash bins. Top 10 results displayed
    9. Extension 3 : Here, compared the 3 distance metrics : Intersection, Chi-Square in extension2.cpp
    and correlation Distance square in : correlationDst.cpp file
    I had to implement correlation distance metric into other file as I was not able to display and print all images in single file. That is why I decided to split file.
